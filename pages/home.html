	    <h1>Hi, i'm Leviathan!!</h1>
	    <p>...and this is my website!</p>
	    <p>Mostly just made because I just wanted a landing page for my domain, taking a lot of inspiration from some past project built for some server management thing that didn't really develop, mixed with some inspiration from another website I made as a main page and then promptly just ignored for the rest of it's existance, I made this. It's not the greatest thing ever, but I'd say I did pretty well with it. It's hosted on netlify (for now) but eventually I'll get a proper server and host everything with that. :3</p>

	    <p>This page mostly just holds all of my interests and projects, most recently being <b>this website</b> on 4/7/2024. I'm not very experienced, I just do this all for myself. About actually learning HTML: It was partly just me cruising through my tech class. Believe it or not, I actually learned... something! Later on, I made my first website on October 2021, alongside my <a href="https://neocities.org/site/laevateinn" target="new">Neocities site</a>, formerly named "morrowseer". (don't call me that btw) I made more and more updates and variations of the page, having to remake it in 2022 or so. I then made new pages, including the one that was just a Firefox recreation in-site! I'm done with rambling, so thanks for reading, I guess ;-;</p>
