    <h1>Hi, i'm Leviathan!!</h1>
	<p>...and this is my website!</p>
	<p>Mostly just made because I just wanted a landing page for my domain, taking a lot of inspiration from some past project built for some server management thing that didn't really develop, mixed with some inspiration from another website I made as a main page and then promptly just ignored for the rest of it's existance, I made this. It's not the greatest thing ever, but I'd say I did pretty well with it. It's hosted on netlify (for now) but eventually I'll get a proper server and host everything with that. :3</p>
	<p>This page mostly just holds all of my interests and projects, most recently being <b>this website</b> on 4/7/2024. I'm not very experienced, I just do this all for myself.</p>
