	<p>My sanity isn't though. ;w;</p>
	<p>I promised myself I would make this... and uhhhh, it's finally here! This is more of just a test page for now, I'm trying to work on theme support (as was the original plan for my site) so please stay tuned on that!</p>
	<p>I don't really have much else to write for now, but I will soon.</p>
